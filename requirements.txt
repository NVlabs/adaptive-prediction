# The reason why we separately install l5kit is:
# l5kit is currently not maintained, but it requires numpy~=1.19.0 for some reason, 
# which means installing it normally will downgrade numpy from its usual version (1.22.3) to 1.19.5.
# Normally this is fine, but other packages (e.g., torch) in this
# were built above according to numpy being in the 1.2X
# range, and will crash on import if numpy is not the correct version.
# Accordingly, we first install l5kit's dependencies and then l5kit at the end.
